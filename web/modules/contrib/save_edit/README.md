# Save & Edit D8


## Introduction

Save & Edit is a module that provides a very simple, yet welcome function to node editing pages.

The module simply adds a button titled "Save & Edit" on node types selected in the admin section. Using this
extra button when saving a node will simply redirect back to the edit form rather than returning to the node
page, or the /admin/content/node page.

I've felt like this was needed more than once, and as simple as the module is, provides a very much needed
feature to core node editing. I find myself frequently creating long, drawn out nodes where I have the need to
save the node regularly to avoid losing changes/edits, and then it takes an additional click to get back to the
edit form to continue.

## Features

- Creates a "Save & Edit" button on node pages.
- Allows you to choose what node types to use the feature on.
- Allows you to customize the text for "Save & Edit", "Save & Publish", AND the default Drupal node "Save"
  button to whatever you like
- Allows you to choose to use the Auto-Unpublish feature, which will mark nodes as unpublished when you use the
  Save & Edit button. This can either be turned off, used on ALL nodes/clicks of the Save & Edit button, or can
  also be only used on NEW nodes. This was a much needed addition.
- For ANY unpublished nodes, a new "Publish" button will allow you to quickly Save & Publish a node that was
  previously marked unpublished. This feature will be hidden on published nodes, and new nodes with the
  "Published" option checked by default.
- Allows to hide each of the default "Save", "Preview" and "Delete" buttons
